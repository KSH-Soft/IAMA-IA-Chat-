<p align="center">IAMA is a lightweight Windows application that takes the form of a small chatbot located at the bottom right of the screen. This chatbot is powered by local AI, is fully configurable, and is designed to be used in both standalone and server modes, enabling large-scale centralized management.</p>

<p align="center">
IAMA is not a general-purpose AI like ChatGPT. It is a local artificial intelligence, controlled and restricted as needed. It is designed to assist users with simple tasks, with a high level of security and control over its responses.
<br>
The main objective of this project is to offer an intelligent, customizable assistance system that can be used in professional, educational, or social environments, while ensuring compliance with an institution's internal rules.

<p align="center">
<h2 id="technologies">🖥️ Windows application
IAMA runs directly on a Windows computer. The interface takes the form of a small chatbot window, which is discreet but easily accessible.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
<h2 id="technologies">🧠 Configurable local AI</h2>
The AI operates locally, with adjustable settings to limit:<br>
- the type of responses,<br>
- the topics accessible,<br>
- the style of interaction with the user.<br>
This modularity allows the AI's behavior to be adapted to various contexts (schools, businesses, help centers, etc.).<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
<h2 id="technologies">☁️Server mode</h2>
IAMA can be deployed on a server so that all PCs in an establishment can connect to it.<br>
This allows you to:<br>
- log conversations,<br>
- centralize configuration,<br>
- quickly update or patch the AI,<br>
- monitor system usage.<br>
</p>
<br><br>
<p align="center">
<h1 id="technologies">🎓 Use cases :</h2>
</p>

<p align="center">
<h2 id="technologies">🏫 Education sector</h2>
IAMA can be made available to students, with a strict filtering system to ensure:<br>
- responses appropriate for education,<br>
- compliance with school rules,<br>
- the absence of inappropriate content.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
<h2 id="technologies">🧩 Help for people in need</h2>
The app can assist users who need simple information, such as:<br>
- “How do I do X?”<br>
- “Where can I find Y?”<br>
- “What is the procedure for Z?”<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
<h2 id="technologies">⚙️ Local technical support</h2>
IAMA can be enhanced with customized resources (procedures, internal guides, etc.).<br>
Example: What to do when a PC loses its Internet connection?<br>
- Check the network cable or Wi-Fi.<br>
- Restart the box or local router.<br>
- Test the connection on another device.<br>
- Contact a technician if the problem persists.<br>
This system allows simple problems to be filtered and resolved automatically without the need for qualified personnel.<br>
